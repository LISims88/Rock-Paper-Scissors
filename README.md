# Rock, Paper, Scissors!

## Abstract:

In this project I built a functional web game that allows the user to play two versions of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game is set up to look like an 80's Arcade game with an option to play the classic version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, or the challenging version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Alien. After each round the game has a 5 second delay before the game is reset to the original board.

## Learning Goals:

This project is a part of the curriculum of Turing School of Software and Design. The project itself was used to showcase our understanding of JavaScript foundations, CSS and Semantic HTML. Part of the process of this was to understand how to build a project from the ground up through planning and working in increments to ensure a playable bug free game.

## Wins + Challenges:
The largest challenge I faced while creating and completing this project was realizing the importance of how unique classes should ALWAYS be. I originally didn't realize that in the case of making basically two games that I would need two game boards and that adding on to the original would cause bugs. In creating the secondary challenge game board, there needed to be board specific classes for the elements in order to manipulate the DOM correctly. Through troubleshooting and bouncing thoughts off of another person I quickly was able to debug the issue and create proper DOM manipulation. 

The largest win I accomplished was understanding the use of cloning an element, creating a class for the element, and being able to style it to the specifications of the element that it is cloned to. It was a new concept for me and it has the potential to be useful in the future.
